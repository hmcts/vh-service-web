        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="navigation-and-accessing-information">Navigation and accessing information</h3>

        <p>There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option). This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks).</p>

        <p>It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation).</p>

        <p>It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text).</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="interactive-tools-and-transactions">Interactive tools and transactions</h3>

        <p>Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a ‘label’ tag.</p>

        <p>Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (information and relationships).</p>

        <p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>

        <p>Many of our older PDFs and Word documents don’t meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).</p>

        <p>Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.</p>

        <p>The accessibility regulations <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">don’t require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we don’t plan to fix [example of non-essential document].</p>

        <p>Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="live-video">Live video</h3>

        <p>Live video streams don’t have captions. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.4 (captions - live).</p>

        <p>We don’t plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations</a>.</p>
